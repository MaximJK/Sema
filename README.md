# Sema

> Sema is a javascript app that presents poetry in a beautiful, readable,
> form to encourage slow reading and to conveniently display
> auxiliary information to aid reader's interpretative efforts.
> Sema is a first attempt to bring poetry online by creating a framework that
> functionally and seemless displays the text and pertinent information
> in a organic fashion without losing the slow and intentional pacing
> that great poetry requires. Sema is intuitive to use: click on a line
> from a randomly generated poem to enlarge it and bring it to the
> center of the screen. Click on a word to fetch and display
> its definitions, etymology and other information culled from the
> Oxford English Dictionary API. Press a direction button to advance to
> the next line or jump back, then click anywhere else to return to the
> full poem. Adjacent to the poem are drop downs
> displaying information about the poems author. When the reader is done
> they can advance to another poem.
